# Discord-node.js-chat-bot
A general purpose Discord chat bot written in Node.js

# Motivations
Despite there being a fair bit of public discord bots out there, many of them turn out to be unsafe and lack privacy so I wanted to create
a customisable discord bot for myself and others to use. This project has allowed me to get a better grasp on using APIs and to make 
useful features that were not offered by other bots.
